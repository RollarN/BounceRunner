Smol Prototype - Focus on Design patterns clean blueprinting
UE 4.24

This is a very, very, small prototype where i experimented around making blueprints readable by collapsing nodes with descriptory nodes.

I learned alot about that, while also learning some gameplay design lessons
1 - The User experience of fps movement mechanics should be focused on the actual sensation.
2 - To followup, focus on sensations above novelty. The original prototoype was novel, but hardly enjoyable to use.
